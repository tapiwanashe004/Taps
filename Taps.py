#PROGRAMING ASSIGNMENT 1#


#In programing, variables refers to named storage locations that hold data which can change during program execution#
user_name= "Tapiwanashe"  #Here username is a variable as it can change during program execution depending on the user
                         # at that time#

#Constants refers to named locations whose values remain fixed throughout the
# program's execution. Python does not have built-in constants but people can use uppercase to indicate a constant#
Pi= 3.14159 #Pi is a constant that stores the value 3.14159. #

#The print function refers to the fundamental output operation that displays information to the console or another output device#
print(user_name )
print(Pi)


#Below is a code with variables, constant and the print function#
